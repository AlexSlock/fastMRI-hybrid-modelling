## Used dataset
In this thesis, the fastMRI dataset is used.

Important stuff we need to comply with:

> a. In any published abstract, I will cite “NYU fastMRI” as the source of the data in the abstract.

> b. In any published manuscripts using data from NYU fastMRI, I will reference the following paper: https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.2020190007

> c. I will include language similar to the following in the methods section of my manuscripts in order to accurately acknowledge data source: "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the NYU fastMRI Initiative database (fastmri.med.nyu.edu).[citation of Knoll et al] As such, NYU fastMRI investigators provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A listing of NYU fastMRI investigators, subject to updates, can be found at: fastmri.med.nyu.edu. The primary goal of fastMRI is to test whether machine learning can aid in the reconstruction of medical images".
